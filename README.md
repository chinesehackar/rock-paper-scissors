# rock-paper-scissors

This exercise tests my knowledge in building arguably one of the most rudimentary games--rock, paper scissors. It purely uses the console in the web browser so expect an empty page. Note that there is no reprompting to test for user input. For it to work, input "rock", "paper", or "scissors" in either uppercase or lowercase. Enjoy!
